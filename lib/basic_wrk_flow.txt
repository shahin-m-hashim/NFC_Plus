Here's a basic workflow for building a Flutter app:

    1. 
    The runApp function is the entry point of your application, and you pass a widget as a parameter to 
    it. This widget becomes the root of your widget tree, and you can add other widgets as children to it.
    In the main() function, call runApp() and pass in the root widget of your app. This is similar to 
    setting the body in HTML.

    2. 
    In most cases, the root widget will be either MaterialApp(Android) or CupertinoApp(IOS), depending on 
    which design language you want to use. Then you can add different widgets to the app and arrange them 
    in a tree-like structure.Choose the appropriate root widget for your app based on your needs. The most
    common are MaterialApp and CupertinoApp. Adding a title and theme to the MaterialApp is optional, 
    but it can be useful for setting the app's metadata, such as the app name and the default color scheme.
    The theme property is used to set the overall visual style of the app, such as the primary color, 
    the text style, and the elevation of the widgets.The primaryColor property, for example, sets the 
    default color for many widgets in the app, such as the app bar, floating action button, and more. 
    The textTheme property, on the other hand, sets the default text styles for the app, such as the 
    font family, font size, and font weight.

    In a Flutter app, you can only have one primary theme defined for the MaterialApp or the CupertinoApp, 
    depending on whether you are building a Material or a Cupertino (iOS-style) app. However, you can 
    customize the theme for individual widgets by passing a ThemeData object to the widget's constructor.

    3.
    Within the root widget, specify the necessary properties such as title, theme, and home. This is 
    similar to adding attributes to the html, head, and body tags in HTML.

    4.
    Build your app by creating and nesting widgets as needed within the root widget. Widgets can be 
    either stateless or stateful depending on your needs.

    5.
    Each widget is built using the build() method, which returns a widget that is then displayed on the 
    screen.

    6.
    Widgets can be styled using various properties and attributes, such as color, padding, and margin. 
    These properties can be set directly on the widget or defined in a separate Theme widget for consistent
    styling across the app.

    7.
    Flutter also provides a variety of pre-built widgets that can be used to quickly create common UI 
    elements such as buttons, text fields, and images.

    8.
    As your app grows more complex, you may need to use additional features such as state management, 
    routing, and external dependencies.

In summary, the root widget serves as the entry point for your app, and widgets are used to build the UI. 
Flutter provides a variety of pre-built widgets and styling options, and additional features can be added 
as needed for more complex apps.
