Firebase Authentication is a service provided by Firebase, a mobile and web application development platform 
owned by Google. It provides a secure and easy-to-use way to authenticate users in your app, using email 
and password, phone numbers, or other popular identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

Firebase Authentication offers a range of features such as email verification, password reset, and 
multi-factor authentication. It also supports OAuth2 for authentication with third-party providers.

In addition to authentication, Firebase provides other services such as Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, 
Cloud Functions, and Analytics that can be easily integrated with your app.

Overall, Firebase Authentication is a powerful and flexible tool that can help you quickly add 
authentication and security features to your app, without having to build them from scratch.

Sure, here are some common functions for Firebase Authentication services that you may need to implement in your Flutter app:

    Future<UserCredential> signInWithEmailAndPassword(String email, String password) -

    object upon successful sign-in.
