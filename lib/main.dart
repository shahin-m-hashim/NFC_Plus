Here are some important terms related to the basics of Flutter:

Widgets: Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app. Everything that you see on the screen 
is a widget, from simple text to complex UI elements.

State: In Flutter, state refers to the current condition of a widget. It can change dynamically, and 
when it does, the widget will be rebuilt.

StatefulWidget: StatefulWidget is a widget that has mutable state. When the state changes, the widget
is rebuilt.

StatelessWidget: StatelessWidget is a widget that does not have mutable state. Once it is built, it does 
not change.

MaterialApp: MaterialApp is a predefined widget in Flutter that provides basic app functionality like 
navigation, theming, and title.

Scaffold: Scaffold is another predefined widget in Flutter that provides a basic visual structure for your 
app, including a navigation drawer, app bar, and body.

Layouts: In Flutter, layouts are used to position widgets on the screen. There are many types of layouts, 
such as Row, Column, Stack, and GridView.

ThemeData: ThemeData is a predefined class in Flutter that provides a set of colors and fonts that you can 
use to style your app.

MediaQuery: MediaQuery is a widget in Flutter that provides information about the device's size and 
orientation. It can be used to create responsive UIs that adapt to different devices.

Navigator: Navigator is a widget in Flutter that manages the navigation stack. You can use it to navigate 
between screens and manage the back button.
